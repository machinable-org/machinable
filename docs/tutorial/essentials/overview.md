# Essentials for getting started quickly

In this section we will introduce the bare-minimum of concepts necessary to start using machinable. Along the way, we will provide pointers to sections of the tutorial that discuss concepts in more detail or cover more advanced functionality.

After covering the essentials, feel free to pick a learning path that suits your preference - although we do recommend going over all of the content at some point, of course!

:::tip

We recommend [installing machinable](../installation.md) to try things out while following along.
